If you are interested in working with us on Internet of Robotics Things, scene understanding, world models for robotics applications, we’d love to hear from you.
Please explain how your background fits with these areas, what you would like to do, and why you would like to join MRG.

There are multiple ways to join us:
- **PostDocs**: PostDoc positions are always posted on the Engineering Science jobs page. They are only occasionally available and typically connected to a funded research project. There are other routes to join the team including EPSRC PostDoctoral Fellowships and Marie Curie Fellowships. Get in touch if you’d like support with an application.
- **PhD (DPhil)**: Please apply to the DPhil in Engineering Science course and name Daniele De Martini as a supervisor. It’s important to make your application for the December deadline to be eligible for Oxford’s scholarships and other funding sources.
- **Centers for Doctoral Training (CDTs)** are basically coordinated programmes for training PhD student in a certain topic - with scholarships from the UK government and companies. You should also consider applying to one of the three in my area: RAINZ, AIMS or Intelligent Earth.
- **Final-year project (4YP)**: Oxford students from Engineering Science (or Computer Science). Please reach out if you are interested in a (closed) 4YP project and/or if you would like to initiate a student project.
- **Internship**: Each year we host 1-2 interns over the summer. Please find more information about internships at ORI and name Daniele De Martini as a supervisor in your application. Most commonly Oxford undergrads can be funded through the EUROP or EPSRC Vacation Internship scheme.
- **Visiting students**: Students from other institutions can occasionally visit ORI - for example working on a Masters thesis or collaborating on a project.

In brief, please contact Daniele De Martini about of these opportunities.
