Daniele is a Departmental Lecturer in Mobile Robotics and co-leads with Professor Paul Newmand the Mobile Robotics Group. He is also a College Lecturer in Engineering Science at Pembroke College.

Daniele is interested in robust navigation and scene understanding -- from odometry and localisation to detection and segmentation -- enabling the deployment of robots in challenging weather and scenarios. He is exploring techniques to improve robustness either by utilising inherently more robust sensors, focusing on FMCW scanning radar technology, or enhancing the training of perception modules.
