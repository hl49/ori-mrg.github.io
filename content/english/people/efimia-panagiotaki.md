She is also working part-time at [Oxa](https://oxa.tech) as Senior ML Engineer. Her DPhil is on deep graph learning, neural algorithmic reasoning, semantic localisation, and scene understanding for ground robotics applications. During her DPhil she has been the research lead of the [RobotCycle(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10981746)] project.

Before starting her DPhil, Efimia was working at StreetDrone (acq. by OXA) and spent time at Williams F1 Racing Team. She studied Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) and worked with the Prom Racing Formula Student Team throughout her studies. She conducted her master's thesis at ETH Zurich with AMZ Racing Driverless and the Computer Vision Lab (CVL).
