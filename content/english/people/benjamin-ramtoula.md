I am currently a DPhil (PhD) student at the Mobile Robotics Group of the University of Oxford supervised by Paul Newman. I also work part-time at [Oxa](https://oxa.tech). My DPhil is being pursued as part of the [CDT in Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems](https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk), and focuses on representations for images and datasets.

Before moving to Oxford, I studied at EPFL, ČVUT, and the MISTLab of Polytechnique Montréal. I also spent some time at MSL in Stanford, and in Team CoSTAR at NASA JPL, working on the DARPA SubT Challenge.
 
I am originally from [Nantes, France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nantes).
