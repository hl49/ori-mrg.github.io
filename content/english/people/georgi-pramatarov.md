Georgi started his DPhil at the Mobile Robotics Group (MRG) in 2020 under the supervision of Prof. Paul Newman and working closely with Prof. Daniele De Martini.
His research goals are to enable scalable and lifelong navigation of mobile platforms by producing minimal mapping representations without sacrificing localisation quality.

Prior to his DPhil, Georgi obtained a Master in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Oxford in 2018, and joined [Oxa](https://oxa.tech), where he now works part-time.
