I am a DPhil (PhD) student of [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), supervised by [Prof. Daniele De Martini](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/people/daniele-de-martini/), [Prof. Paul Newman](https://www.ori.ox.ac.uk/people/paul-newman/), and [Prof. Philip Torr](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~phst/). I also closely work with [Prof. Lars Kunze](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/people/lars-kunze/) and [Dr. Matt Gadd](https://mttgdd.github.io/). Prior to this, I completed my undergraduate studies in Engineering Science also at [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/). Previously, I worked as research intern at [Meta FAIR](https://ai.meta.com/research/), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/) and [Oxa](https://oxa.tech/). My research interest lies in multimodal generative modeling.
