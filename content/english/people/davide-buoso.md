I am an ELLIS PhD Student @ VANDAL, Turin, Italy. I was a Visiting Student at the University of Oxford, where I worked within the Mobile Robotics Group (supervised by Dr. Daniele De Martini) and the Torr Vision Group (supervised by Tim Franzmeyer and Prof. Philip Torr). I graduated cum Laude in Data Science and Engineering at Polytechnic University of Turin. 

I am interested and currently working in the application of generative models to robotics and how to learn manipulation skills from human videos.
