Matt was a Postdoctoral Research Assistant in the Mobile Robotics Group, a Stipendiary Lecturer in Engineering Science at St Hilda's College, and a Junior Research Fellow at Kellogg College.

In terms of enabling the autonomy of intelligent machines, Matt was interested in navigation and scene understanding in general, including mapping, localisation, detection, and segmentation. In all of these cases, he was particularly interested in achieving more robust performance in challenging conditions for vision and LiDAR and is similarly an enthusiastic adopter of FMCW scanning radar.

Matt contributed to various projects at ORI, including Europa2, DRIVEN, SAX, and Embodied Intelligence.

Matt held a BSc in Mechatronics Engineering from the University of Cape Town and a DPhil in Engineering Science from Keble College.
