Sarah joined the group in 2016 as an MSc(Res) student. She received her BSE in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from Princeton University where her thesis analysed the consensus problem for Markov switching graphs with and without leaders.

Sarah was advised by Paul Newman, and her research at ORI focused on performing localisation and navigation using only the output of a scanning radar.
