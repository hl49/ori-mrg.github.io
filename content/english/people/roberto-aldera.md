Roberto joined the Oxford Robotics Institute in 2017 as a DPhil student at Pembroke College. He completed his BSc (Eng) in Mechatronics at the University of Cape Town where his thesis focused on control and jump stabilisation of a bio-inspired mobile robot, drawing inspiration from jumping spiders and their use of silk draglines in aerial righting.

His research interests at the Oxford Robotics Institute were centred on navigation in mobile robotics using radar. When not in the lab, Roberto enjoyed trail running and playing the guitar.
