I am a visiting research student at MRG, working under the supervision of Benjamin Ramtoula and Prof. Daniele De Martini. I am also a Master's student at the University of Freiburg, supervised by Julia Hindel and Prof. Abhinav Valada. My research focuses on feature fusion in visual foundation models for image segmentation, aiming to identify and combine the most relevant features without additional backbone training.
