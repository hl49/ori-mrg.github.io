Luigi joined the Oxford Robotics Institute in October 2018 to study for his DPhil in Engineering Science as a member of Somerville College. The topic of his research was path and motion planning for floating-base robotic systems, and he was supervised by Ioannis Havoutis.

Luigi held a BSc in Mechanical Engineering from Politecnico di Bari and a MSc in Mechatronic Engineering from Politecnico di Torino. He was a visiting student at EPFL to develop his Master’s thesis in soft-modular robotics, for which he was given a certificate of excellency from the Italian Minister of Defence during the SeaFuture 2018 international exhibition.

After the completion of his Master’s degree, he worked for several months in Politecnico di Bari to study data analysis and machine learning.

Luigi was a football fan (Juventus FC supporter), was passionate about philosophy, and loved swimming and fishing.
